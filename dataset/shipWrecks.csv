To ALL this tribute is sincerely proffered, and particularly to Captain Samuel Debona [sic, Delano], of Duxburough, for his singularly benevolent, noble, and spirited exertions, who at the risk of his own life, ventured into the boisterous waves, and providentially reached the wreck, for the kind purpose of preventing the sufferers attempting to land in their then situation, but to wait until the tide would admit of their getting safely on shore, and to inspire their almost exhausted spirits every possible degree of fortitude, with the assurance of a ready assistance as soon as it was possible for help to reach them from the beach.

The names of those lost besides the master, are, Mr. John Nichols of Salem, mate; Peter Union, John Chappell, Williams Brooks, and Giles Pike of Marblehead, seamen. Capt. Porter (in whose death society has lost a very respectable, enterprising, and valuable member) was son to the Rev. Nathaniel Porter, of Conway, N.H., a clergyman much respected for learning, and venerable for his age and piety. It appeared that on the approach of night, the wind blowing fresh at the eastward, Capt. Porter consulting his mate on the expediency of running in for the land, they being very short of water, having but about 3 gallons on board, and as they supposed they knew their situation (having spoken a vessel out for the land that day) on mutual deliberation concluded to run in; sounding several times in the evening until they shoaled the water to 17 fathoms. Concluding that they were on the northern shore they hauled off to the southward; shortly after they sounded and had 40 fathom water; continued their course to the southward until nearly 8 o'clock P.M. when they saw breakers, and immediately were ship and stood off - directly after which she struck. After beating for two hours she bilged and filled the cabin with water: the mate and people then left the cabin (except the two that were saved) and went forward and lashed themselves [to] the bows, being then quite out of water; sometime after the bows settled away in the cavity of the rocks, when all those lashed forward were drowned; the captain continued about the decks doing everything in his power for the preservation of the whole until after three o'clock A.M.; he then called to the people that were holding on the combings of the companion way, and asked if they were alive; they answered, though the water was nearly up to their mouths; in a few moments he was heard no more. His body was taken up together with those of the mate and the people that morning, and on the following Sabbath were carried into the meeting-house, where a sermon adapted to the occasion was preached to a large concourse of people by the Rev. Mr. Shaw, from Prov. xxvii 1 ""Boast not thyself of tomorrow, for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth,"" when the bodies were interred.""[15]",,,,,,,,,,,

The fleet sailed from Havana on September 20, 1641 but was heavily hit by a hurricane nine days later. Concepción got separated from the main fleet and tried to make for Puerto Rico, but on October 31 foundered and sank on a sand bank north of Hispaniola, which is now called Silver Bank after this shipwreck.
First found by William Phips in 1687, his operation managed to salvage 34 tons of silver and other treasure[a]. Back in England the expedition's revenue was assessed as £205,536[b].
In the 20th century it was the object of several known treasure hunting expeditions: A. Korganoff in 1952, Edwin Link in 1955, Falcon-Barker in 1962[4] and Cousteau in 1968, until finally being re-discovered by Burt Webber in 1978.
